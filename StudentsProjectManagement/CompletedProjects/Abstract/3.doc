I feel not good, always didn't, my plans are destroyed.
I always hated them, and always will, you cannot change me.
I gave you many chances, you thought there were just options.
And you waited for more easy options,But for sure, don't expect from me, i won't give you easy one never.
When it was your chances,you left me many options, i chose the hardest one.
You want me to take easy one, i knew it would be easy and what i become a lazy.
You thought you win,And see now you are under my knee.
Still i gave you chances, to give me more options.
Now i don't need your fucking options, leave them behind your stinking ethics.
Now i ll decide my option.
Thanks for guiding me to the hell i deserve.
Thanks my parents
